# MyLocalProjects
Simple Local Projects manager

 This is a very simple local projects laucher/managment tool that I use for my development projects. 
 HTML, CSS, PHP, Jquery, twitter bootstrap are used in the making.
 It Makes it easier for me than typing the url every time I want to test projects. 
 
 What it Does:
 
 1. you can create a link to anything you like. It is a single page app, gives the ability to create custom links your local projects 
 or any other links to your favorite sites, the page displays list of links your created with edit and delete icons on the side of each list
 2. posibility of editing the link or deleting 
 
How it works:

1. Just put it into your local web server's document root
2. edit the db.php file. link it your local mysql database and create a table named (sites) - with 3 columns:(sitename 
sitetype, sitelink) all with varchar datatype.
